## Overview
A dynamic workout planner web application made for my personal purpose. 
As someone who actively works out every day, I wanted a more manageable 
way to track my progress over time. This web app facilitates the users to search exercises instruction, 
create their workout plan, track their exercise progresses, 
and record their workout histories. The whole system is developed by myself 
single-handedly.

## Tech Stack & Libraries
- <SiReact /> <span> **React** for the frontend application </span>
- <SiExpress /> <span> **Express** for the back end application </span>
- <SiMongodb /> <span> **MongoDB** for the database management system </span>
- <SiTailwindcss /> <span> **TailwindCSS** for css utility classes </span>
- <SiRedux /> <span> **Redux Tool Kit** for the frontend state management </span>

## Lesson Learned
Fun fact, this is the first time I built web application that separates
between backend application and frontend application. So, I decided to
adopt the MERN stack as it's perfect for beginner who wants to deep dive
in this kind of architecture. The learning curve has been steep, 
as I had to familiarize myself with the React component lifecycle, 
the communication between frontend and backend, the concepts of MongoDB 
as a NoSQL database, and the implementation of Redux Toolkit for state 
management. Each of these technologies was new to me, presenting 
significant challenges along the way.

At the end, I feel it's really worth my dedication! Even though the UI is 
not that attractive, I have gained a wealth of new skills through this project. 
It has opened the door for me into the JavaScript world of web development and 
laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors.
