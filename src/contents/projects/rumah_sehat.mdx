## Overview
RumahSehat is a hospital information system project as part 
of my Enterprise Application & Application Programming
course assignment. The system provides features for patients, 
doctors, and pharmacists to perform business processes such as
make appointments, buy medicines, and view medicine sale reports. 

## Tech Stack & Libraries
- <SiSpring /> <span> **Java Spring Boot** for the web application framework (monolithic fullstack) </span>
- <SiFlutter /> <span> **Flutter** for the mobile application framework </span>
- <SiMysql /> <span> **MySQL** for the database management system (DBMS) </span>
- <SiBootstrap /> <span> **BootstrapCSS** for css component and utility classes </span>

First, let me explain there are 4 roles in this system include
doctor, pharmacist, patient, and admin. The web application
is used by doctor, pharamacist, and admin to do their job.
While in the other hand, the mobile application is served for 
the patient specifically to book appointments and buy medicines.
So, the web and mobile app has it's own purpose in this system.

## Lesson Learned
I can say this project is the one that opened my perspective how 
modern softwares are built. The source code itself implemented
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture that follow SOLID
principles to enhance it's readability and maintainability. 

I also learn how to containerized a web application or service
by Docker and setup CI/CD by utilizing GitLab Pipeline, so the 
deploying and the testing process of the application is triggered
whenever there are update in the main branch.
