## Overview
Truckman is a trucking management system (TMS) project that is dedicated 
for PT Petaling Jaya Indonesia internal operation. If we look at the as-is 
business processes, all the operation are done manually, lacking a cohesive 
information system. The solution that me and my team provide is a web 
application that consist of features such as order & delivery 
management, invoice generator, and dashboard for the manager. This solution
aims to enhance efficiency and visibility across the organization.

## Tech Stack
- <SiSpring /> <span> **Java Spring Boot** for the web application framework (monolithic fullstack) </span>
- <SiMysql /> <span>**MySQL** for the database management system (DBMS)</span>
- <SiBootstrap /> <span>**BootstrapCSS** for css component and utility classes</span>

## Lesson Learned

To be honest, this is my first poject that are built
for real user. My responsibility as a tech lead demands me to
manage 4 other engineer in terms of their technical skill and
behavior. So, i decided to design my own git workflow as a development
guideline to prevent unwanted mistake on the application.
The git branches that i create are:
- **main** - the production branch, it's only me who have the right to
get in touch of this branch.
- **dev** - the staging branch, where all of the engineers create 
merge/pull requests from their own feature branch.
- **(engineer-name)/(feature-name)** - The branch to develop a certain 
feature, the separation aims to prevent mistake in the staging and production branch.

The other challenge is how I manage my time to finish the backlog
implementation in every sprint while I'm also taking courses in my
college.
