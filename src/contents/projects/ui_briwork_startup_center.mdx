## Lesson Learned
During development, one of the main challenges I faced was meeting the tight deadline 
set by the client. They required us to expedite the development process in anticipation 
of a community inauguration event that would also showcase the introduction of a mobile 
application. To address this urgency, we opted to use Django, which is known for its 
rapid development capabilities. Finally! we made it to implement the Minimum Viable 
Product (MVP) of the app to present it in the inauguration.

On the technical side, a significant challenge was integrating the system with the 
Midtrans Payment Gateway, which offered limited support for cross-platform frameworks 
like React Native. However, my team and I remained dedicated to overcoming these obstacles, 
and through collaboration and creative problem-solving, we were able to ensure a smooth 
payment process within the application.
